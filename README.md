# Intelliherd

Intelliherd is a project that I have been working on for some time that allows users to track their animals and keep data such as expenses, health, and other data about animals.

## System76 Unleash Your Potential 

I am documenting the progress of the project as part of [System76's](https://system76.com) Unleash Your Potential program. I am going to be doing all of my development on a System76 Pangolin laptop.

Huge thanks to System76 for supporting myself and the Open Source community as a whole.
