# Intelliherd

Intelliherd is a project that I have been working on for some time that allows users to track their animals and keep data such as expenses, health, and other data about animals.

## Roadmap 

This project already has a functioning base. However, some items need to be cleaned up or redone. The basic roadmap for the project is as follows:
- [ ] Database Changes
- [ ] REST API
- [ ] Adjustments to Flask Web App
- [ ] Flutter API Package
- [ ] Flutter UI/Backend

## System76 Unleash Your Potential 

I am documenting the progress of the project as part of [System76's](https://system76.com) Unleash Your Potential program. I am going to be doing all of my development on a System76 Pangolin laptop.

Huge thanks to System76 for supporting myself and the Open Source community as a whole.
